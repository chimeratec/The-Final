# Goals and Aspirations

​	Currently I do not know where the future will take me. I could serve as little as the 4 year requirement the Army has for me, or I could go career and serve over twenty.

​	My current plan of attack is to serve as long as I'm enjoying Army life, and after using my resources here in Columbia Missouri to get employment after. I'm currently working part time for <em>Veterans United</em>, and would like to work for them again after my time serving is done and make use of my degree!
